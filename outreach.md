### Hello!

I love drawing from a very young age. I learned sketch with a teacher during my primary school, and here are two Voltaire I drew at that time.

<br/><br/>But actually, I perfer to draw things that are fancier. Here are some examples. 

Fig.1: I like drawing caricatures. This one is not original, but with a little modifications. The title is <i>Trendy Gadgets</i>. You know what it means.

Fig.2: I like using my drawings to show some interesting concepts. Like this one, I draw it to illustrate "[Droste effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect)".

Fig.3: I hope you can see who this is, since it's very recognizable portrait. Plus, that was my first time drawing with carbon pen.

Fig.4: Many popular drawing techniques which bring fun visual effect, that sort of thing.

<br/>After entering university, I started to learn digital drawing and started experimenting with graphic design.

      Here are some of the elements I designed for the IGEM(International Genetically Engineered Machine) team of our univerisity. (The UCAS-IGEM team has won gold for the third consecutive year!) I designed this using PhotoShop.

In the future, I would like to try more with modern tools, and I will use more colors. Science and art are never separate. I hope I could use my paintings to get involved in some popular science work.
