I love drawing from a very young age. I learned sketch with a teacher during my primary school, and here are two Voltaire I drew at that time.

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <img src="https://yinruiliu.github.io/Voltaire1.jpg" width="100%"> 
    </td>
    <td width="50%">
      <img src="https://yinruiliu.github.io/Voltaire2.jpg" width="100%"> 
    </td>
  </tr>

<br/>But actually, I perfer to draw things that are fancier. Here are some examples.

  </tr>

<i>Fig. 1</i>: I like drawing caricatures. This one is not original, but with a little modifications. The title is <i>Trendy Gadgets</i>. You know what it means.<br/>
<i>Fig. 2</i>: I like using my drawings to show some interesting concepts. Like this one, I draw it to illustrate "[Droste effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect)".<br/>
<i>Fig. 3</i>: I hope you can see who this is, since it's very recognizable portrait. Plus, that was my first time drawing with carbon pen.<br/>
<i>Fig. 4</i>: Many popular drawing techniques which bring fun visual effect, that sort of thing.

<br/>After entering university, I started to learn digital drawing and started experimenting with graphic design.

    <td width="40%">
      Here are some of the elements I designed for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Genetically_Engineered_Machine">IGEM</a>(International Genetically Engineered Machine) team of our univerisity. (The UCAS-IGEM team has won gold for the third consecutive year!) I designed this using PhotoShop. All elements were made from scratch.

    <td width="30%">

  </tr>
</table>

<br/>In the future, I would like to try more with modern tools, and I will use more colors. <b>Science and art are never separate.</b> I hope I could use my paintings to get involved in some popular science work.
